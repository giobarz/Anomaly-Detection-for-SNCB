# Anomaly Detection for SNCB
This project was developed as part of a Data Mining course at Ecole Polytechnique de Bruxelles (ULB) in collaboration with SNCB. The aim was to detect anomalies in train data using advanced data mining techniques. Through exploratory data analysis and machine learning algorithms, the project identified irregular patterns in the dataset, providing actionable insights for improving train operations and maintenance.
